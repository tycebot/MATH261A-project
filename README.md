Author:Terrell Enoru

Date of Submission: 9/24/2025

Structure: The project contains three key folders analysis,data, and paper. Paper contains the quarto file containing the analysis as well as the report produced by it. Data is for the dataset(not included because of license) and analysis is for any additional data analysis that does not fit in the quarto document(currently contains placeholder file). In the base folder there are three notable files. This readme, a .gitignore specifying what files I do not want to upload to the repository , and a template file.
